Our notebook 490C Final Project contains all the code for our anaylsis. 
A large portion of our code is modified versions of code from class notebooks.
The code follows this order:
-Setup

-Load the data from its original format as a Table() from the datascience package
  - load_genre_reviews() took about 20 minutes to run.

-Save the Table() as a master CSV so it is easily reloadable.

-We then look at basic metrics of our data

-Tokenization

-Write each individual genre as its own .txt file so the supplied code from 
previous notebooks works with our data.

-Feature Analysis

-Classification

-Comparison

-Clustering
